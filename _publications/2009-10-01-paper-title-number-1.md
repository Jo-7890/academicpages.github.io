abstract: 'Wayfinding is a crucial process for individuals to navigate and explore their environment in daily life. When compared to the traditional use of paper maps, modern navigation aids have been found to hinder individuals' environmental spatial knowledge. Previous researches have shown that navigation factors, such as navigation mode and scale, impact how individuals perceive and process spatial information. For instance, the user-aligned mode helps individuals build an egocentric representation of space, while the north-on-top mode promotes the formation of an allocentric representation. Additionally, small-scale maps assist in establishing spatial relationships between objects using an allocentric representation, while large-scale maps provide a perspective of nearby space, facilitating an egocentric representation. However, there is a trade-off between wayfinding performance and spatial knowledge acquisition. To address this trade-off, this study aims to investigate which combination of navigation factors best supports spatial knowledge acquisition. Previous researches have limitations; for instance, the scale was not controlled as an independent variable and lacked a measurement task that assesses all three types of spatial knowledge. To address these gaps, this study established a measurement task for each type of spatial knowledge and used two scales (1:50 and 1:200) as independent variables, continuing to incorporate the north-on-top and user-aligned modes commonly studied. The objective of this research was to investigate the impact of mobile navigation factors (navigation mode, scale) on individuals' wayfinding performance and spatial knowledge acquisition in a virtual 3D environment, considering the factor of gender.
In Experiment 1, 96 participants (48 males, 48 females) were recruited. Initially, the participants were required to complete a virtual spatial task consisting of two phases: wayfinding and return. After completing all ten routes, the participants were required to complete the spatial knowledge test, which consisted of five tasks such as landmark recognition and route sequence tasks. The scores from these tests were collected and analyzed, and three factors were extracted through factor analysis. Building upon the typical measurement task defined in Experiment 1, Experiment 2 employed a 2 (scale: small-scale 1:200, large-scale 1:50) x 2 (navigation mode: user-aligned mode, north-on-top mode) x 2 (gender: male, female) between-subjects design. The dependent variables in this experiment were participants' scores on the spatial knowledge measurement task and wayfinding performance. The number of participants was 96 (calculated by G-power), and the experiment process was as same as Experiment 1. Experiment 2 revealed the following: when coming to route knowledge acquisition, there were significant interactions between gender and navigation mode. Specifically, males performed significantly better in the north-on-top mode compared to the user-aligned mode, while the opposite was true for females. On large-scale maps, the user-aligned mode was more conducive to route knowledge acquisition than the north-on-top mode, aligning with an egocentric representation. Conversely, on small-scale maps, the north-on-top mode was more convenient than the user-aligned mode, aligning with an allocentric representation. A main effect of navigation modes on wayfinding performance was observed, with subjects' wayfinding performance being better in the user-aligned mode than in the north-on-top mode. The results of both experiments indicated an interaction between navigation mode and scale: combinations of navigation factors that suit the individual can help individuals establish a consistent spatial frame of reference, enhancing route knowledge acquisition. 
The innovations of this article are as follows: Firstly, this study has refined the spatial knowledge measurement task and established a comprehensive measurement task for three types of spatial knowledge, thus providing new ideas for reducing measurement errors and conducting measurements systematically and efficiently. Secondly, this study, based on the spatial reference framework theory, found that the influence of mobile navigation factors on spatial knowledge learning and wayfinding performance is conditional. When navigation factors facilitate individuals to process environmental information with a consistent reference framework, it promotes the acquisition of route knowledge.'
